# Design Principles

These principles guide our design decisions and ensure consistency across all components and experiences.

## 1. Visual Hierarchy

Our design system emphasizes modern and clean visual hierarchy through balanced spacing and clear typographic scales. Every element serves a purpose in guiding users through their journey, creating intuitive paths that reduce cognitive load while maintaining visual appeal.

## 2. Consistency & Coherence

Modern and clean design language ensures consistency across all touchpoints. Our harmonious component library maintains coherence through standardized patterns, unified color palettes, and systematic spacing that creates a seamless user experience.

## 3. Accessibility & Inclusion

Accessibility is fundamental to our modern and clean approach. We design for diverse abilities and needs, ensuring our interfaces are usable by everyone. This includes proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and clear visual indicators for all interactive elements.

## 4. Performance & Efficiency

Our modern and clean design system prioritizes performance through optimized component architecture. We focus on fast loading times, efficient interactions, and lightweight implementations that don't compromise on visual quality or user experience.
