# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement SuperDev HTML Features Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive HTML generation tool that provides component preview capabilities, interactive development features, and real-time visual feedback for enhanced development experience.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive SuperDev HTML features tool with the following components:

1. **HTML Generation Engine** (src/tools/superdevHTML.ts):
   - Create `generateHTMLPreview` function that converts component data into standalone HTML files
   - Implement template system with hot-reload capabilities: `const htmlTemplate = createTemplate({head: tailwindCSS, body: componentMarkup, scripts: interactiveFeatures})`
   - Support multiple output formats: standalone HTML, iframe-embeddable, and live preview modes
   - Generate responsive preview grids showing components at different breakpoints

2. **Component Preview System**:
   - Build interactive component gallery with live prop editing capabilities
   - Implement real-time component rendering using design tokens from Task 5
   - Create component isolation sandbox with proper CSS scoping
   - Add component state management for interactive previews (hover, focus, active states)

3. **Interactive Development Tools**:
   - Implement live design token editor with instant visual feedback
   - Create component prop inspector with real-time value modification
   - Add accessibility testing overlay showing ARIA attributes and contrast ratios
   - Build responsive design testing tools with device simulation

4. **Visual Feedback System**:
   - Implement real-time component diff visualization when props change
   - Create visual regression testing capabilities with screenshot comparison
   - Add component performance metrics display (render time, bundle size impact)
   - Build interactive style guide with copy-paste code snippets

5. **Integration Layer**:
   - Connect with existing component analysis from Task 6 for automatic preview generation
   - Integrate with Storybook setup from Task 8 for seamless development workflow
   - Use design tokens from Task 5 for consistent theming across previews
   - Implement MCP tool registration following patterns from Task 3

6. **Export and Sharing Features**:
   - Generate shareable preview URLs with embedded component state
   - Create exportable HTML packages for stakeholder review
   - Implement component documentation generation with interactive examples

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing approach for SuperDev HTML features:

1. **HTML Generation Testing**:
   - Unit tests for template generation with various component configurations
   - Validate generated HTML is valid and includes all required assets (CSS, JS)
   - Test responsive preview generation across multiple breakpoints
   - Verify hot-reload functionality updates previews without full page refresh

2. **Component Preview Validation**:
   - Integration tests for component gallery rendering with real component data
   - Test prop editing interface updates component previews in real-time
   - Validate component isolation prevents CSS bleeding between previews
   - Test state management for interactive component demonstrations

3. **Interactive Tools Testing**:
   - Test design token editor updates all affected components simultaneously
   - Validate prop inspector accurately reflects component interface
   - Test accessibility overlay shows correct ARIA information and contrast ratios
   - Verify responsive testing tools accurately simulate different device sizes

4. **Visual Feedback System Testing**:
   - Test component diff visualization highlights actual changes
   - Validate screenshot comparison detects visual regressions
   - Test performance metrics display accurate render times and bundle sizes
   - Verify code snippet generation produces working, copy-paste ready code

5. **End-to-End Integration Testing**:
   - Test complete workflow: analyze components → generate tokens → create interactive previews
   - Validate Storybook integration works seamlessly with existing setup
   - Test MCP tool registration and proper error handling
   - Verify export functionality generates working standalone HTML packages

6. **Performance and Usability Testing**:
   - Measure preview generation time for projects with 50+ components
   - Test memory usage during extended development sessions
   - Validate preview loading time is under 2 seconds for typical components
   - Test cross-browser compatibility for generated HTML previews
