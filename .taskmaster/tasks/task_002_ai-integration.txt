# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement parseDesigns Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert design inputs (text, image placeholder, code snippets) into structured Design JSON through prompt engineering, markdown parsing, LLM response handling, JSON validation, error recovery, and performance optimization.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive parseDesigns tool with the following components:

1. **Input Processing Pipeline**: Create a multi-format input handler that can process:
   - Raw text descriptions of designs
   - Markdown-formatted design specifications
   - Code snippets (HTML, CSS, React components)
   - Image placeholder references and metadata
   - Mixed-format inputs combining multiple types

2. **Prompt Engineering System**: Develop sophisticated prompts for LLM interaction:
   - Design-specific prompt templates for different input types
   - Context-aware prompts that adapt based on input complexity
   - Few-shot examples for consistent JSON structure generation
   - Prompt optimization for different design patterns (layouts, components, interactions)

3. **Markdown Parser**: Build a robust markdown parsing engine:
   - Extract structured information from markdown headers, lists, and code blocks
   - Preserve formatting context and hierarchy
   - Handle nested structures and complex markdown syntax
   - Convert markdown elements to design specification components

4. **LLM Response Handler**: Create intelligent response processing:
   - Parse and validate LLM-generated JSON responses
   - Handle partial or malformed responses gracefully
   - Implement response streaming for large inputs
   - Extract design elements, properties, and relationships from natural language

5. **JSON Validation Engine**: Implement comprehensive validation:
   - Schema validation against Design JSON specification
   - Semantic validation of design properties and relationships
   - Cross-reference validation between design elements
   - Custom validation rules for design-specific constraints

6. **Error Recovery System**: Build robust error handling:
   - Automatic retry mechanisms for failed LLM calls
   - Fallback parsing strategies for malformed inputs
   - Progressive degradation for partial parsing failures
   - User-friendly error messages with suggested corrections

7. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for large inputs:
   - Chunking strategies for oversized design specifications
   - Parallel processing of independent design components
   - Caching of parsed design patterns and templates
   - Memory-efficient streaming for large file processing
   - Rate limiting integration with LLM provider constraints

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation:
   - Mock LLM responses for various design input scenarios
   - Test markdown parser with complex nested structures
   - Validate JSON schema compliance with edge cases
   - Test error recovery with intentionally malformed inputs

2. **Integration Tests**: Verify end-to-end functionality:
   - Process real design specifications from text to JSON
   - Test with various input formats and combinations
   - Verify LLM integration through the established layer
   - Test performance with large design files (>10MB)

3. **Validation Tests**: Ensure output quality and consistency:
   - Compare parsed designs against manually created reference JSON
   - Test semantic accuracy of extracted design elements
   - Verify preservation of design intent and relationships
   - Validate handling of ambiguous or incomplete specifications

4. **Performance Tests**: Measure and optimize processing speed:
   - Benchmark parsing times for various input sizes
   - Test memory usage with large design specifications
   - Verify rate limiting compliance and efficiency
   - Test concurrent processing capabilities

5. **Error Handling Tests**: Verify robust error recovery:
   - Test with corrupted or incomplete input files
   - Simulate LLM API failures and timeouts
   - Test graceful degradation with unsupported input formats
   - Verify error message clarity and actionability
