# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement MCP Server Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Bootstrap stdio MCP server with modular tool handlers, Zod validation pipeline, and comprehensive server lifecycle management.
# Details:
1. **Server Bootstrap & Initialization**
   - Create main server entry point (src/server.ts) with stdio transport setup
   - Initialize MCP server instance with proper configuration
   - Setup graceful shutdown handlers for SIGINT/SIGTERM signals
   - Implement server state management (starting, running, stopping, stopped)

2. **Tool Registration System**
   - Design modular tool handler architecture with interface definitions
   - Create ToolRegistry class to manage tool registration and discovery
   - Implement dynamic tool loading from designated directories
   - Support both synchronous and asynchronous tool handlers
   - Add tool metadata management (name, description, schema)

3. **Request Routing & Middleware**
   - Implement request dispatcher to route MCP requests to appropriate handlers
   - Create middleware pipeline for request preprocessing
   - Add request/response logging middleware for debugging
   - Implement rate limiting and request validation middleware

4. **Zod Validation Pipeline**
   - Install and configure Zod for schema validation
   - Create validation schemas for all MCP request/response types
   - Implement validation middleware that integrates with request pipeline
   - Add custom error messages and validation error formatting
   - Support schema composition for complex nested validations

5. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Implement centralized error handling middleware
   - Create custom error classes for different error types (ValidationError, ToolError, etc.)
   - Add error logging with structured logging format
   - Implement error recovery strategies for non-fatal errors
   - Add error response formatting according to MCP protocol

6. **Server Lifecycle Management**
   - Implement server startup sequence with dependency checks
   - Add health check endpoints for monitoring
   - Create configuration management system with environment variable support
   - Implement hot-reload capability for development
   - Add metrics collection for performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test server initialization with various configurations
   - Verify tool registration system with mock tools
   - Test request routing with different MCP request types
   - Validate Zod schemas with valid/invalid payloads
   - Test error handling with simulated failures

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test complete request/response cycle through stdio transport
   - Verify tool handler execution with real MCP client
   - Test server lifecycle events (startup, shutdown, restart)
   - Validate middleware pipeline execution order
   - Test error propagation through the entire stack

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure request processing latency under load
   - Test memory usage during extended operation
   - Verify graceful degradation under high request volume
   - Test tool registration performance with many tools

4. **Manual Testing**
   - Start server and verify stdio communication
   - Test tool discovery and registration
   - Validate error responses are properly formatted
   - Confirm server responds to shutdown signals gracefully
   - Test configuration loading from environment variables
