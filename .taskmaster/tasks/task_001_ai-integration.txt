# Task ID: 1
# Title: Build LLM Integration Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an abstract communication layer for OpenAI and compatible LLM providers with built-in caching, rate limiting, and error handling capabilities.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive LLM integration layer with the following components:

1. **Abstract LLM Provider Interface**: Create a base interface/abstract class that defines standard methods for chat completion, streaming, and configuration. This allows for easy swapping between different LLM providers.

2. **OpenAI Client Implementation**: Build a concrete implementation for OpenAI API including:
   - Authentication handling with API keys
   - Request/response serialization
   - Support for different models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
   - Streaming response handling for real-time chat

3. **Caching Layer**: Implement intelligent caching to reduce API costs and improve response times:
   - Use Redis or in-memory cache for storing responses
   - Cache key generation based on request parameters
   - TTL configuration for cache expiration
   - Cache invalidation strategies

4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion:
   - Token bucket or sliding window algorithm
   - Configurable limits per time window
   - Queue management for pending requests
   - Graceful degradation when limits are reached

5. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**: Robust error handling for:
   - Network timeouts and connection failures
   - API rate limit errors (429 status)
   - Authentication failures
   - Exponential backoff retry strategy
   - Circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures

6. **Configuration Management**: Support for:
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Multiple API key rotation
   - Model selection and parameters
   - Timeout and retry settings

7. **Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring API usage, costs, and performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Verification approach includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each component in isolation:
   - Mock OpenAI API responses for different scenarios
   - Test caching behavior with various cache states
   - Verify rate limiting logic with simulated high-frequency requests
   - Test error handling with different failure modes

2. **Integration Tests**: Test the complete flow:
   - Real API calls to OpenAI (using test API keys)
   - End-to-end streaming response handling
   - Cache hit/miss scenarios
   - Rate limit enforcement under load

3. **Performance Tests**: Measure and validate:
   - Response time improvements with caching
   - Rate limiting effectiveness
   - Memory usage under different load patterns
   - Concurrent request handling

4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Simulate and verify handling of:
   - Network failures and timeouts
   - API rate limit responses
   - Invalid API keys or authentication failures
   - Malformed requests and responses

5. **Configuration Testing**: Verify:
   - Different provider configurations
   - Environment variable loading
   - Configuration validation and error reporting

6. **Manual Testing**: Interactive testing of:
   - Streaming chat responses
   - Cache behavior observation
   - Rate limit notifications
   - Error message clarity and usefulness
