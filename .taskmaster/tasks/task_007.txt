# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement generateInstruction Tool
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Combine parsed design data and component analysis to create actionable implementation instructions.
# Details:
src/tools/generateInstruction.ts
export const generateInstructionHandler=async({design,components})=>{
 const prompt=`Using design JSON: ${JSON.stringify(design)} and components: ${JSON.stringify(components)} produce detailed steps following InstructionSchema`;
 const content=await complete(prompt,{temperature:0.2});
 return InstructionSchema.parse(JSON.parse(content));
};

# Test Strategy:
Integration test:
- Provide mocked design & component JSON, expect InstructionSchema passes.
- Assert instructions mention existing component names.
- Latency <8s on sample dataset.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Data Preparation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Collect, clean, and structure data from multiple sources for complexity analysis reasoning tasks
### Details:
Gather relevant datasets, perform data cleaning operations, normalize formats, and organize data structures to support complexity analysis workflows
<info added on 2025-07-11T02:21:19.591Z>
Starting data preparation phase:

**Data Sources Identified:**
1. Design data from parseDesignAndGenerateTokens output (DesignSchema format)
2. Component data from analyzeComponents output (ComponentSchema format)
3. Both inputs are optional to allow flexible usage

**Data Preparation Strategy:**
- Accept design and component data as separate optional inputs
- Validate inputs against existing schemas (DesignSchema, ComponentSchema)
- Extract relevant information for instruction generation:
  - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
  - Component patterns and naming conventions
  - Props and component structure
  - Framework context (React, Vue, etc.)

**Input Schema Design:**
- design: optional Design object from DesignSchema
- components: optional array of Component objects from ComponentSchema
- options: optional context like framework, styling approach, etc.

This approach allows the tool to work with either design data alone, component data alone, or both combined for maximum flexibility.

## 2. Prompt Template Creation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Design and develop reusable prompt templates for complexity analysis reasoning tasks
### Details:

<info added on 2025-07-11T02:28:07.258Z>
✅ **Prompt Template Creation - COMPLETED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Created comprehensive `INSTRUCTION_GENERATION_PROMPT` template with 200+ lines
- Structured template includes:
  - Clear task definition and context setup
  - Detailed output format specification with JSON schema
  - Step-by-step requirements (actionable descriptions, proper ordering, dependencies)
  - File structure guidelines (components, styles, tests, stories)
  - Context requirements (framework, styling, testing approach)
  - Framework-specific considerations (React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Testing Library)
  - Best practices enforcement (modern patterns, testing, documentation)

**Template Features:**
- Dynamic placeholders for design/component data injection: {design}, {components}, {options}
- Comprehensive output structure matching InstructionSchema
- Production-ready implementation guidance
- Proper dependency management and ordering
- Error handling and validation instructions

**Template Structure:**
1. **Task Definition** - Clear role and objective
2. **Input Context** - Structured data placeholders
3. **Requirements** - Step arrays, file objects, context objects
4. **Output Format** - JSON schema with examples
5. **Key Principles** - Implementation guidelines
6. **Framework Considerations** - Technology-specific guidance

The template is ready for dynamic data injection and LLM processing.

## 3. LLM Instruction Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Generate specific instructions for language models to perform complexity analysis reasoning
### Details:
Develop detailed instructions that guide LLMs through multi-step reasoning processes, define expected output formats, and specify how to handle dependencies on previous tools and results
<info added on 2025-07-11T02:29:15.480Z>
**LLM Instruction Generation - COMPLETED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Integrated with existing LLM infrastructure via `complete()` function from `src/llm/index.ts`
- Uses optimal settings for instruction generation:
  - Temperature: 0.2 (low for consistent, structured output)
  - Max tokens: 6000 (sufficient for comprehensive instructions)
- Supports both Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI models with automatic provider selection
- Handles multi-modal input (text + image) for design analysis
- Includes proper error handling for LLM failures

**LLM Integration Features:**
- Automatic provider selection (Anthropic preferred, OpenAI fallback)
- Built-in caching for repeated requests
- Rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
- Proper prompt construction with dynamic data injection
- Structured output generation following InstructionSchema

**Data Flow:**
1. Validate input (design, components, options)
2. Prepare context with helper functions
3. Inject data into prompt template
4. Call LLM with optimal parameters
5. Parse and validate response
6. Return structured instruction object

The LLM integration is complete and ready for testing.

## 4. Output Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement validation mechanisms to ensure generated outputs meet quality and format requirements
### Details:
Create validation rules for structured outputs, implement error checking for reasoning consistency, and establish quality gates to verify completeness and accuracy of complexity analysis results
<info added on 2025-07-11T02:30:00.816Z>
**Output Validation - COMPLETED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Implemented comprehensive `validateInstructionOutput()` function
- Multi-layer validation approach:
  1. **JSON Parsing**: Validates raw LLM output as valid JSON
  2. **Schema Validation**: Uses Zod InstructionSchema for strict type checking
  3. **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for debugging

**Validation Features:**
- JSON syntax validation with error details
- InstructionSchema compliance checking
- Required field validation (steps, files)
- Type safety for all nested objects
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

**Validation Rules:**
- **Steps Array**: Must contain valid step objects with description, type, order
- **Files Object**: Must be valid key-value pairs (path -> content)
- **Metadata**: Optional but validated if present
- **Context**: Optional framework/tool preferences validation

**Error Handling:**
- Catches JSON parsing errors
- Provides detailed Zod validation errors
- Logs errors for debugging
- Returns meaningful error messages to users
- Maintains type safety throughout validation chain

**Output Format:**
- Returns validated, typed instruction objects
- Ensures all downstream code receives valid data
- Prevents runtime errors from malformed LLM output

The validation system is robust and ready for production use.
