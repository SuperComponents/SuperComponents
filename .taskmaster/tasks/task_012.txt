# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Comprehensive Testing Suite for analyzeComponents Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a complete testing framework for the analyzeComponents tool including unit tests, integration tests, and validation of component analysis functionality covering prop extraction, pattern detection, and file parsing accuracy.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive testing suite for the analyzeComponents tool with the following components:

1. **Unit Test Suite** (src/tools/__tests__/analyzeComponent.test.ts):
   - Test AST parsing for various component types (React functional, class components, Vue SFC)
   - Validate prop extraction accuracy with TypeScript interfaces, PropTypes, and default props
   - Test pattern detection for common component patterns (HOCs, render props, compound components)
   - Error handling tests for malformed syntax, missing files, and unsupported file types
   - Mock file system operations using jest.mock('fs') and fast-glob

2. **Integration Test Suite**:
   - Create realistic test fixtures with complete component libraries in test/fixtures/
   - Test end-to-end component analysis workflow from file discovery to ComponentSchema validation
   - Verify cross-file dependency detection and import resolution
   - Test performance with large codebases (100+ components)

3. **Validation Test Suite**:
   - Snapshot testing for consistent prop extraction results
   - Schema validation tests ensuring all outputs conform to ComponentSchema
   - Regression tests using real-world component examples from popular libraries
   - Edge case testing: empty files, comments-only files, mixed JS/TS syntax

4. **Test Fixtures and Utilities**:
   - Create comprehensive component fixtures covering React, Vue, Angular patterns
   - Build test utilities for AST comparison and component signature validation
   - Implement custom Jest matchers for component analysis assertions

5. **Performance and Reliability Tests**:
   - Memory usage tests for large file processing
   - Concurrent file processing validation
   - Error recovery and graceful degradation testing

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive testing validation:

1. **Unit Test Validation**:
   - Run `npm test -- analyzeComponent.test.ts` with 100% code coverage requirement
   - Verify all prop extraction scenarios pass: TypeScript interfaces, PropTypes, default props, destructured props
   - Validate pattern detection accuracy: expect 95%+ detection rate for common patterns
   - Test error handling: malformed files should be skipped without crashing

2. **Integration Test Validation**:
   - Create test project with 50+ diverse components, run analyzeComponentHandler
   - Verify ComponentSchema.array().parse() succeeds on all outputs
   - Performance benchmark: analysis should complete <5s for 100 components
   - Cross-reference detected components with manual audit for accuracy validation

3. **Fixture-Based Testing**:
   - Test against React component library fixture: expect detection of all exported components
   - Vue SFC fixture testing: validate prop extraction from <script setup> and Options API
   - Snapshot testing: `expect(analysisResult).toMatchSnapshot()` for regression protection

4. **End-to-End Validation**:
   - Integration with existing codebase: run against actual project, manually verify 10 random components
   - Schema compliance: all outputs must pass ComponentSchema validation
   - Error logging: verify graceful handling of unparseable files with detailed error messages

5. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add test suite to GitHub Actions with matrix testing across Node 16, 18, 20
   - Performance regression detection: fail if analysis time increases >20% from baseline
