# Task ID: 17
# Title: Remove Deprecated Code and Clean Up Legacy Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Systematically remove deprecated tools like parseDesign.ts and other legacy code, clean up unused imports, update documentation, and ensure the codebase is maintainable and follows current patterns.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive codebase cleanup process with the following components:

1. **Legacy Tool Identification and Removal**:
   - Audit existing tools directory to identify deprecated implementations like parseDesign.ts
   - Remove legacy parseDesign.ts since it's been replaced by parseDesignAndGenerateTokens.ts (Task 5)
   - Clean up any remaining references to old tool handlers in MCP server configuration
   - Remove deprecated utility functions that are no longer used

2. **Import Cleanup and Dependency Analysis**:
   - Use tools like `depcheck` or `unimport` to identify unused imports across the codebase
   - Remove unused import statements from all TypeScript/JavaScript files
   - Clean up package.json dependencies that are no longer referenced
   - Update import paths to use consistent patterns and remove circular dependencies

3. **Code Structure Modernization**:
   - Consolidate duplicate utility functions into shared modules
   - Remove commented-out code blocks and TODO comments that are no longer relevant
   - Update function signatures to use consistent TypeScript patterns
   - Refactor any remaining callback-style code to use async/await patterns

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update README.md to remove references to deprecated tools and features
   - Clean up inline code comments that reference removed functionality
   - Update API documentation to reflect current tool implementations
   - Remove outdated examples and usage patterns from documentation

5. **Configuration Cleanup**:
   - Update MCP server tool registry to remove deprecated tool handlers
   - Clean up TypeScript configuration files to remove unused compiler options
   - Update build scripts to exclude deprecated files from compilation
   - Remove unused environment variables and configuration options

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive validation of codebase cleanup:

1. **Build and Compilation Verification**:
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure no compilation errors after cleanup
   - Verify TypeScript strict mode passes without unused variable warnings
   - Test that all remaining imports resolve correctly without missing dependencies

2. **Tool Functionality Validation**:
   - Run integration tests for all remaining MCP tools to ensure they still function correctly
   - Verify that parseDesignAndGenerateTokens tool works without any references to old parseDesign implementation
   - Test that analyzeComponent and other tools don't have broken import paths

3. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Run `npm audit` to check for unused dependencies in package.json
   - Use `depcheck` to verify no unused npm packages remain
   - Confirm that all import statements resolve to existing files

4. **Documentation Accuracy**:
   - Manually review updated documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - Verify that all code examples in documentation use current API patterns
   - Test that installation and setup instructions work with cleaned codebase

5. **Performance Impact Assessment**:
   - Measure bundle size reduction after cleanup
   - Verify that build times haven't increased due to cleanup changes
   - Test that MCP server startup time remains optimal
