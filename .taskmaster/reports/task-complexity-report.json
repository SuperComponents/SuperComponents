			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into discrete configuration steps: repository initialization, package management, TypeScript configuration, build scripts setup, and testing framework configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to multiple tool configurations and dependencies. Well-defined steps but requires coordination between different tools (Git, npm, TypeScript, Jest)."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Core Schemas",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate schema definition into individual schema files, type inference setup, schema validation testing, and schema documentation with examples.",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity. Straightforward Zod schema definitions but requires careful type design and comprehensive validation testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement MCP Server Core",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into server initialization, tool registration system, request routing, error handling middleware, validation pipeline, and server lifecycle management.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to integration with MCP SDK, error handling, and request routing. Requires understanding of the MCP protocol and proper async handling."

			"taskTitle": "Build LLM Integration Layer",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into OpenAI client setup, caching implementation, rate limiting, streaming support, and error handling for API failures.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving external API integration, caching strategy, and rate limiting. Requires robust error handling and performance optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement parseDesigns Tool",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into prompt engineering, markdown parsing, LLM response handling, JSON validation, error recovery, and performance optimization for large inputs.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to LLM integration, prompt engineering, and handling unpredictable LLM outputs. Requires robust parsing and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement analyzeComponent Tool",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into file discovery, AST parsing setup, component extraction logic, prop signature analysis, error handling for malformed code, performance optimization, and result aggregation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving AST parsing, file system operations, and complex code analysis. Requires handling various component patterns and syntax errors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement generateInstruction Tool",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into data preparation, prompt template creation, LLM instruction generation, output validation, and instruction quality assessment.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity combining multiple data sources and generating structured output. Depends on previous tools and requires sophisticated prompt engineering."
